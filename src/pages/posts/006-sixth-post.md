Are you sure that your browser configuration is unique? Are you convinced that you cannot be tracked simply because you blocked external cookies?


The truth is that every time you visit a website, your browser creates a report about its configuration: fonts, browser tyoe, cookies, add-ons, screen resolution... If this combination of information is unique, you ight be tracked even wihtout using cookies.


You can test your browser now on https://panopticlick.eff.org/ and find out what your browsers are reporting. Disabling Javascript, using Linux... will make your browser stick out from the masses. Modern browser were not designed to protect your privacy. Rather than worrying about being fingerprinted, a more practical solution would be to use free woftware plugins like Privacy Badger (https://www.eff.org/privacybadger), uBlock Origin (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), HTTPS everywhere(https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere), TOSDR (https://tosdr.org/), and Cookie AutoDelete (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/)
