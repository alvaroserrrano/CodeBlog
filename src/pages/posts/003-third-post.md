Even though Cambridge Analytica is usually portrayed as a psychological warfare against an unsuspecting public, we can't deny that much of the data mined and analyzed was public. We expose ourselves through social media on a daily basis, even by answering those innocent Facebook quizzes about our favorite Disney character.
