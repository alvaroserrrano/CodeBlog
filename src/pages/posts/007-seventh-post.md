"Plan, design, build, test, deliver ... repeat"...

"Plan, design, build, test, deliver ... repeat"...

"Plan, design ..." Wait a minute! We live in a rapidly changing world that is centered around short delivery times, don't we?

If you want to make a car, or a building, it is okay to follow that procedure. However, software development requires a flexible, fast and continuous approach to deliver products and services that require continuous improvements in quality. That is why the industry of software quickly transitioned to Agile methodologies using tools like Scrum and eXtreme programming.

Imagine your company working on a project for months, even years, and it turns out that the project ends up being a failure because of a simple mistake in the early phase of development. Agile methodologies solve that problem by providing solutions in a fast and incremental way. For that purpose, these methods require a constant communication between employees and customers.

Agile methodologies look to deploy their first pieces of work in a couple weeks in order to deploy the entire piece of software in a couple months. As a consequence, communication between teams is key. Agile teams work together at every stage of the project and on a daily basis. Rathen than waiting for ultimate success or failure, these teams track their results regularly and its participants adjust the process continually.

Once an application of Agile is chosen, like Scrum, XP, Crystal, Kanban... companies focus on live training rather than theory. Continuous integration, and keeping the code up to date, helps tom minimize the time and effort required by each integration. There exists a rule that states that no programmer should ever leave anything unintegrated at the end of the day. Another core value is customer collaboration. The customer should always be aware of the progress of the development team. Therefore, we can infer that pair programming, test-driven development, automated tests... are common practices among the companies that embrace this methodologies.

Of course there are some disadvantages too. The very high degree of customer involvement may present som problems for customers who simply do not want to devote their time for this participation. Also, because Agile focuses on time-boxed delivery and frequent repriorization, it is possible that some items set for the delivery will not be completed within the allotted timeframe. Besides, the close working relationships in an Agile project are easier to manage when the team members are located within the same physical workspace.

Although we are starting to see the mass adoption of various Agiles methodologies, we should not ignore the importance of a more traditional approach. Some projects just need to follow a sequential approach and it would be very inefficient for them to continuously deploy their work.
