"Why do I have to worry about my privacy on the Internet? I have nothing to hide. I do not commit online crimes. I am not a cybercriminal"

Unfortunately, the above mentioned sentence is taking root in the society. Now it is time to ask ourselves the following questions:
-Would you share your home address with a stranger?
-Would you share pictures of yourself and your family with a stranger?
-Would you share your routine, health status, or financial issues with people outside your inner circle?
-Would you allow external people to share your information?

Another idea that has rooted within current users' mentality is that the people who seek to be anonymous on the web are always people who try to hide something from companies and authorities due to legal issues. However, the truth is that the engineers and people who develop online tools such as TOR, FreeNet or I2P, are people who worry about the integrity of our information.

Every time we surf the web through any device, our personal activity leaves behind complex traces of data. Tracking techniques are employed by companies and authorities to shape our online identity. When we use an online service, we must be aware that the data does not travel to our destinatary in a direct way. Instead, it passes through third-party users that may visualize, store, or even manipulate such data.

Undoubtedly, Google is one of the most efficient search engines. However, its precission and speed may harm our privacy. Major browsers nowadays include the option "do not indicate my tracking preferences", which is highly recommended to activate so that third party companies can't access our information without our consent. It is also possible to apply a customized configuration regarding our browsing history and about the cookies that we want to store in our browser
